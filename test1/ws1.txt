What is the purpose of the log message you supply to your git commit?
- The log message supplied to a Git commit serves a crucial purpose in version control. When you make changes to files in a Git repository and are ready to save those changes permanently, you create a commit. Each commit represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. The commit log message is a concise description of the changes made in that particular commit.
